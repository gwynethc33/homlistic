  "faq_description": "We value honesty, integrity, & accountability. We have pride in our craft, are professional & value our people.\n\nOur work reflects our quiet devotion to trust, humility, and the invisible strength of values.",
  "faq_box": "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS",
  "faq_question_cost": "What does it cost to work with your company for a renovation?",
  "faq_answer_cost": "Most of our projects fall between $350–$950 per square foot, with a smaller number—around 20%—exceeding $1,000 per square foot.\n\nThis range reflects more than just materials and labor; it speaks to the level of detail, customization, and coordination each build requires. We use per-square-foot pricing as a general framework to help clients understand the investment behind their space.\n\nA 1,000-square-foot build at $100 per square foot, for instance, would total around $100,000. But that figure shifts based on finish level, complexity, and intent. High-end finishes, architectural detailing, or unique constraints naturally raise the rate. Simpler scopes come in lower.\n\nEither way, we approach every project with the same commitment to clarity, precision, and craft.",
  "faq_question_services": "What services do you provide?",
  "faq_answer_services": "As builders, our role goes far beyond managing timelines and budgets. We interpret architectural intent, coordinate trades, oversee site logistics, and ensure every detail aligns with the highest standards of safety, quality, and craftsmanship.\n\nWe work closely with clients, architects, engineers, and inspectors to ensure each structure is not only built to code—but built with integrity.\n\nFrom solving on-site challenges to maintaining seamless workflows, we stay grounded in the belief that how something is built matters just as much as what gets built.",
  "faq_question_fit": "Is Homlistic the right fit for your next build?",
  "faq_answer_fit": "We’re not the right builder for everyone — and we think that’s fine.\n\nAt Homlistic, we build best when there’s alignment: in communication, in expectations, and in values. That’s why we’re intentional about who we work with, and why we take the time to understand what matters most to you before we ever break ground.\n\nWe’re a good fit if you’re someone who:\n  - Values quality over shortcuts\n  - Wants transparency, not guesswork\n  - Sees building as a partnership — not just a transaction\n  - Appreciates the long game: craftsmanship, clear timelines, and thoughtful execution\n\nHow we work together matters just as much as what we build.",

  "homlistic_description": "Homlistic was founded on a powerful principle: In an industry often clouded by opacity, we lead by honesty and transparency.\n\nAs a construction management and general contracting firm operating at the highest level of craftsmanship, Homlistic builds with intention, integrity, and an unwavering respect for both people and process. This belief guides everything Homlistic does.\n\nThe name Homlistic—a fusion of home and holistic—captures this philosophy. It speaks to a building experience that’s complete and considered, one that goes far beyond luxury finishes to focus on how every element comes together, seamlessly and beautifully.\n\nThe result is not just a home—it’s a work of harmony, where craftsmanship reveals the true beauty within design and brings the vision to life.",
